/***************************************************************************
 Semirings:

 A semiring is a collection of function pointers with the following meanings:
 * The extend, combine, and diff functions take two semiring elements as
   arguments and return the result of applying the extender, combiner, or
   difference operator, respectively.
 * Function one() should return the neutral element of the extender.
 * Function zero() should return the neutral element of the combiner
   (which must also be an annihilator of the extender).
 * The quasione function takes a semiring element (say d) as its argument
   and should return a 'quasione' of d, i.e. some element e satisfying
   the property extend(d,e) = d.
 * The value returned by eq(a,b) should be non-zero if semiring elements
   a and b are equal, and zero otherwise.

 For cases where semiring values are complex memory structures, the WPDS
 library supports reference counting. The user can keep reference counts on
 each semiring element and discard an element when its count reaches zero.
 ref should increase the count, deref should decrease it. Both functions
 may be NULL in which case the WPDS library will not use them. It is assumed
 that the functions extend, combine, diff, one, zero, and quasione bump the
 reference count of the elements they return!

 It is good practice to have reference counts saturate at some fixed
 quantity (related to the amount of space provided in each value to hold
 the reference count) and to have one and zero be elements whose reference
 counts are already at the saturated value.

 The function diff is used only in differential mode; otherwise, the pointer
 for it may be NULL. The quasione pointer can safely be set to NULL; in that
 case, the one() function is used instead.

/***************************************************************************

 The core functionality of the library consists of two functions: weighted
 pre* and weighted post*. The library provides two interfaces to them, a
 ready-made, easy-to-use interface, and a more sophisticated one.

 The "ready-made" interface allows to define a weighted PDS and a weighted
 automaton (w.r.t. to the same semiring), fill these with pushdown rules
 and transitions, apply a pre* / post* primitive, and obtain the resulting
 automaton. For more information on this interface, refer to the following
 sections on pushdown systems, finite automata, and the ready-made interface.

 Occasionally, the user may wish to fine-tune the way pre* and post* work,
 usually in order to increase efficiency. This is what the more sophisticated
 interface is for. The basic concept here is that of a "saturation process":
 a saturation process can be fed with pushdown rules and automaton transitions
 (in arbitrary order), and produces automaton transitions as a result. You
 may prefer to use this interface if you want to, e.g.
  * change the order in which transitions are processed (the ready-made
    procedures use a LIFO queue); this makes sense if your semiring has a
    total ordering, or if you want to implement search guidance heuristics;
  * construct the pushdown system on the fly;
  * stop the computation as soon as the interesting part of the result
    is known (e.g. a particular transition is produced).
 For more information on this interface, see "saturation processes" below.

/***************************************************************************
 Configurations and Path (witness generation):
 A configuration simply consists of a control location and a zero-terminated
 array of stack symbols. The wPath structure represents an accepting path in
 some finite automaton, corresponding to a configuration accepted by the
 automaton. In general, a configuration may have multiple accepting paths.

 More precisely, a wPath is a path coupled with a semiring value for each
 transition on the path that has arisen at some point in the computation
 history of the automaton. In general, transitions on the path may have
 assumed different values during the computation.

 The 'value' field of the structure contains the sum (w.r.t. to the extender
 operation) of the transitions on the path. If a path is generated multiple
 times by the library operations, its memory address is reused. (This is
 important because in general, a witness set may be a dag.) Therefore, the
 library supports reference counts on paths.

 A path may be equipped with a list of wPathTrans structures. These contain
 pointers to successor/predecessor paths (depending on whether the automaton
 in question is the result of a pre* or a post* automaton). Such lists are
 generated by the wPathTraceStep/All functions.

 A wPath* value of NULL represents an empty path. If wPathTraceStep/All
 return a transition to a NULL path (with a NULL rule), it means that the
 source path was part of the initial automaton (the one to which a pre* or
 post* operation has been applied).

   is returned. The computation will be carried out in differential mode
   if the semiring associated with the PDS and the FA supplies a diff and
   zero operation.

   Unless the third argument is TRACE_NO, the computation maintains witness
   trace information, and the argument describes exactly how witness nodes
   will change when the value of a transition is updated. Suppose transition t
   currently has value d, and its witness node W has incoming edges E. Moreover,
   suppose the transition is updated with d' such that d+d'<d. Thus, t gets a
   new witness node W' with value d+d' and at least one incoming edge with
   label d'.
   
   TRACE_COPY stands for the method from [RSJM05], i.e. for any element e of E
   with value d'' s.t.  d'<d'' does not hold, W' additionally gets a copy of e.
