This archive contains the source code for the weighted pushdown
library (WPDS).

This library provides functions to compute finite automata for the set
of forwards or backwards reachable configurations in a weighted
pushdown system.  The interested programmer may make use of this
library in other programs (see also the file Copying).

    IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop (CSFW), pages 202-218.

To build the library, type "make" in this, the main directory.  The
Makefile is set up to work for gcc under Linux and Cygwin.

To try out the examples provided with the library, go to the
directories "Examples/linfunc", "Examples/wpdstest", and
"Examples/spkitest", and type "make" in each of them.  See the
comments in Examples/linfunc/linconst.c,
Examples/wpdstest/wpdstest1.c, Examples/wpdstest/wpdstest2.c
Examples/spkitest/spkitest1.c, and Examples/spkitest/spkitest2.c for
more background on these examples.

If you want to use this library in your own projects, see the file wpds.h
for documentation. The programs in Examples/ will also show you how to use
the library. Questions regarding the use of the library should be directed
to Stefan Schwoon <schwoosn@fmi.uni-stuttgart.de>.

** History **

24.03.2003: First public release.

	IMPORTANT change from previous inoffical releases: fa_prestar
	and fa_poststar now return the newly created automaton; they
	no longer modify the automaton given to them as an argument.
	Change your calls to these to functions accordingly!
	(You may not get a warning from gcc if you don't!)

15.05.2003:

	Bugfix in sat_add_rule_post (thanks to David Melski)
	Moved wpds homepage to Stuttgart

21.05.2003:

	Another bugfix in delete_hash_table (reported by David Melski)

06.04.2004:

	Complete code overhaul. Changed all names of functions and data
	structures to a unified naming scheme; changed data structures
	and some arguments to functions (compat.h is provided to ease the
	transition from earlier library versions). Fixed reference counting.
	Added differential mode and quasione function. Witness generation
	is now optional. Added readout algorithm and wConfigValue function.
	More and different functionality for generating witness information.
	More extensive documentation in wpds.h. Introduced some new bugs
	(probably).

22.07.2004:

	Function wSatAddTrans now returns the added or modified transition.

15.12.2004, 21.12.2004:

	Added user fields to wPDS and wFA structures.

April 2005:

	New code in sat.c to support abstraction refinement.

15.03.2006:

	Bugfix in heads.c (dereferencing wrong value).

17.04.2006:

	Added new modes for generating witness traces.
